# OSCKit Examples

These example projects are provided to demonstrate using OSCKit.

- The [OSCKitCASExample](OSCKitCASExample) project is recommended and is the easiest to get started.

- The [NetworkFrameworkExample](NetworkFrameworkExample) project is provided as a blueprint for using your own network I/O library.

## Build Note

If Xcode builds but the app does not run, it may be because Xcode is defaulting to the wrong Scheme. Ensure the example app's Scheme is selected then try again.
