# OSCKit

Open Sound Control library written in Swift.

**Note:** The library does not contain a networking layer so you can modularly integrate OSCKit into whatever network module you choose.

Unit tests implemented.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Add full timetag support
- [ ] Add OSC spec address parsing
- [ ] Add example projects with network layers (ie: Apple's Network.framework)
- [ ] Cross-platform testing
